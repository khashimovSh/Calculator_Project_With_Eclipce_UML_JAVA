#Calculator Project with Eclipce

##**UML**
Created classes in **Class Diagram**: *LogarithmCos, LogarithmCosListener, Cos, CosListener*
Implemented activity **Diagram**, **Sequence Diagram** and **Use Case**: *Log(a)-Cos(a) also for UC7: Cos(a)*
##**JAVA**
Here added required parameters, while calclated cos, first of all calculated *radian* of number and after
*cosine of radian* by following math rules. Also written test for *LogarithmCos* and for *Cos*.
