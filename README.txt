UML:
I created classes in Class Diagram: LogarithmCos, LogarithmCosListener, Cos, CosListener,
also I implement activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram and Use Case for UC6: Log(a)-Cos(a) also for UC7: Cos(a)
JAVA:
Here I add required parameters, while I calclated cos, first of all I calculate radian of number and after
cosine of radian, as you see in my project. Also I make test for LogarithmCos and for Cos.
